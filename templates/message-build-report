If you're release manager, you can issue GPG-inline signed command:

* `Upload-component @RELEASE_NAME@ @COMPONENT@ @COMMIT_SHA@ current all` (available @MIN_AGE_DAYS@ days from now)
* `Upload-component @RELEASE_NAME@ @COMPONENT@ @COMMIT_SHA@ security-testing`

You can choose subset of distributions like:
* `Upload-component @RELEASE_NAME@ @COMPONENT@ @COMMIT_SHA@ current vm-bookworm,vm-fc37` (available @MIN_AGE_DAYS@ days from now)

Above commands will work only if packages in current-testing repository were built from given commit (i.e. no new version superseded it).
