# Service called from network-exposed VM (probably sys-net) into actual build
# VM to (potentially) trigger moving packages from current-testing to current
# repository.
#
# Service input should consists of inline GPG-signed message with just one line:
#
#    "Upload" component_name commit_sha release_name "current" (dists) "repo"
# or
#
#    "Build-template" release_name dist timestamp
#
# (words in quotes are verbatim - without quotes, others are parameters)
# Also, instead of "current", "security-testing" value is supported too.
#
# See README.md for detailed description.
